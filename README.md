tdirstat
========

Terminal-based filesystem tree size browser for my own personal use.

**Usage:** `tdirstat [<directory>]` (`<directory>` defaults to the current working
directory if not specified).

**Navigation:**

  * Use arrow keys to move up/down
  * Press enter to expand/collapse subtrees
  * Press `s` to toggle between sorting by size and sorting by path (re-sorting
    may take a while for large filesystem trees)
